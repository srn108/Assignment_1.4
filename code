#program to find the volume of a sphere using the formula V=4/3 * Ï€ * r3

number = 12
units = "cm"
diameter = str(number) + units

print("The diameter of sphere is: %s  " %diameter )


pie = 22/7

volume_of_sphere = 4/3 * pie * (number/2)**3

print("The volume of a given sphere is %f cm^3" %volume_of_sphere)
